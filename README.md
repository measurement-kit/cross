# Measurement Kit cross build scripts

This repository contains the cross build scripts we use to cross compile
Measurement Kit for iOS, Android, Windows, etc.

The plan is to put these scripts in here and make them installable using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh), such that [our Homebrew based build scripts](
https://github.com/measurement-kit/homebrew-measurement-kit) can depend
on (and use) these scripts.
